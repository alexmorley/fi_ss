You should place the raw data in this directory. The file names and directory nestings don't matter as the system will identify the correct files by their sha1sums.

You must add this directory to your prv search path. To set this up, use
> mlconfig

You can determine if a raw.mda.prv file is found by using
> prv-locate raw.mda.prv
